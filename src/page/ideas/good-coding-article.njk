Hello! ðŸ‘‹. In this workshop, I'm thinking about teaching you how to write a good coding article. You'll come out with an article you're proud to publish.

I'd love to create this workshop for you if enough people show interest. Please let me know about your questions by filling up the following form. I read every response.

  redirect: '/ideas/thanks',
  spreadsheet: '1d8xfWGN85Gxt3lkYspDGb9ayrv1vz5KQyI1TgbVzFRM',
  subject: "Interest in: " + title,
  initialMessage: "Thanks for telling me why you joined Build Your Developer Brand!",
  finalMessage: "That"
} -%}

  {%- formHidden {
    name: 'idea',
    value: 'Interest in: ' + title
  } -%}

  {%- formTextarea {
    name: 'why',
    label: "What's going on in your life that made you want to join this workshop?",
    required: true
  } -%}

  {%- formTextarea {
    name: 'challenge',
    label: "What's your #1 challenge in writing coding articles?",
    helpText: "Tell me the biggest frustration and/or obstacle you faced. Anything goes here!",
    required: true
  } -%}

  {%- formTextarea {
    name: 'help',
