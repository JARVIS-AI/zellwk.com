<h1>Contact Zell</h1>

{% markdown %}
  Thanks for your interest! Please fill out this form and I'll get back to you as quickly as I can. I usually take 3-4 days to reply. :)

  **Please note:** Although I read every email, I don't have the capacity to respond to everyone. I'll only reply if your email aligns with my goals and acknowledge my time and capabilities.
